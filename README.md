# Ensemble-Learning
Hello all,
-This is a project demonstrating the increase in the accuracy of a commomly used unsupervised machine learning technique "Clustering"
making it not easy to determine the performance of the clustering model.
-Hence this project aimed to improve the accuracy of clustering technique using ensemble learning methods after thorough 
research, hit and trial of combining various ensemble methods to achieve the goal.
-And we accomplished the goal through two datsets of a specific domain of "weather forecasting" using clustering.
-And do check out the webpage showcasing the results of the project under https://kshreshta1.github.io/Ensemble-Learning/
-You can check the results by choosing one of the dataset through a drop down menu present on the webpage and explore the improvement 
of clustering through various performance metrics comparision visuals.
