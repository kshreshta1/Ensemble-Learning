# Ensemble-Learning
Hello all,                                   
----This is a project demonstrating the increase in the accuracy of a commomly used unsupervised machine learning technique "Clustering"              
----This project succeeded to improve the accuracy of clustering technique using ensemble learning methods after thorough research of combining various ensemble methods to achieve the goal.            
----And we accomplished the goal through two datsets of a specific domain of "weather forecasting".                                           
----And do check out the webpage showcasing the results of the project under https://kshreshta1.github.io/Ensemble-Learning/              
----You can check the results by choosing one of the dataset through a drop down menu present on the webpage and explore the outcomes of project through comparision visuals of various performance metrics on clustering.
